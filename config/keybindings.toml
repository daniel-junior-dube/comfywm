# MODKEY
# The modkey is used as a macro. Its main purpose is to be a central "control" key.
# We recommend using a modifier key such as Control, Alt or Super (Super would be best).
# To refer to the modkey you may use "$mod" in your bindings.
modkey = "Control"

# KEYBINDINGS
# This is the main section of this configuration. Every entry in this section will be bind to a command.

# KEYCODES
# Comfy uses the XKB standard for the keys, you can use "xev" to find what keycodes you can use. Comfy uses
# special classes for modifier keys, for example "Control" will be translated to "Control_L" and "Control_R".
# You can still use "Control_L" in your configuration.

# ENTRY
# To add entry use this syntax:
# "<keycode>(+<keycode>)*" = "<comfy_command> [<arguments>]"
