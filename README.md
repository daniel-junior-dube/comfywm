## Introduction

Comfy is a Wayland compositor written in the Rust programming language and inspired by i3wm, bspwm and XMonad. It's main goal is ease of use, extensibility and a sane codebase.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Run the following command:

### All test:

```
cargo test
```

### A specific test:

```
cargo test <name of the test>
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

### Using Cargo

```
cargo install comfywm
```

### Built With
